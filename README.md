A cardboard arcade cabinet created for FRC First Power Up 2018.

This cabinet is roughly 3/4 scale and designed to fit into a single suitcase as small as 18"x24" when disassembled. All pieces can be cut from about five "Large" (18"x24") boxes from U-Haul. All pieces are designed to be approximately 18" wide with 2" flaps attached to the center pieces which wrap around the sides and attach to the other center and side pieces. All pieces are connected on the sides by a total of 38 hex-head bolts (1/4") and fastened with wing nuts. Fender washers (68 total) should be added to either side of each bolt to prevent tearing.

This project is a work in progress. Many dimensions have been tweaked to accomodate the CAD toolset with the intent to clarify these dimensions at a later time. When cutting pieces, it is safe to round most dimensions to the nearest whole number, as this is the original intent of the design.
